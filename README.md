# Customer Shopping Carts Tab Fix - Magento 2 Extension 
It will fix an issue in shopping carts tab at customer edit interface in admin described here https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/26437

There is already a pull request https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/26489 going on from us regarding fix of this problem in Magento 2 core. But unfortunately, merging the pull request to Magento 2 core code will take long time and not sure in which Magento 2 version the change will be included.

Hence, we have extracted changes from our pull request and packaged them in this extension. Please feel free to use it till the time this change will be part of Magento 2 core.

Please note that this will only work for Magento 2.3.3 and higher. For lower Magento 2 versions, you can use this extension https://github.com/redchamps/customer-shopping-carts-tab 

## Installation
